# Lab4

## Goal

The goal is to complete `libmin64-ex.asm`, which is just for practicing assembly language.
The entire `chal/` folder is provided by the TA. Inside it, there is a symbolic link pointing to the outer `libmin64-ex.asm`, so you can directly edit it from outside and then test it inside the `chal/` directory.

This lab happened to overlap with the most difficult assignment, HW1, so the workload here is relatively light—mainly to get familiar with assembly language.

## todo

~~Just ask ChatGPT~~
||I also don’t fully understand what `setjump` and `longjump` are doing... I only roughly know they’re for saving some data onto the stack. During the demo, the TA asked a question I didn’t quite understand, but they just let it slide anyway||
