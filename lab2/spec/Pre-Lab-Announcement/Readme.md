# Implement a Kernel Module

Our next lab is to practice implementing a kernel module. The details will be announced next week. Before you play with our lab next week, here are some hints for you to prepare before our lab officially announced.

## Preparation

You may not have experience in implementing a kernel module. Before you start your implementation, you may read some relevant kernel documents and tutorials.

- Please check the `file+stdio` course slide and read the `hellomod` example to see how a simple kernel module is implemented.
- The [Linux kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.6/), including
   - [ioctl based interface](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.6/driver-api/ioctl.html) 
   - [Memory allocation guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.6/core-api/memory-allocation.html)
   - [Memory management APIs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.6/core-api/mm-api.html)
- Also the lab needs to do some cryptographic operation using kernel crypto API.
   - [Block Cipher Algorithm Definitions](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.6/crypto/api-skcipher.html)
   - [Code Example For Symmetric Key Cipher Operation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.6/crypto/api-samples.html#code-example-for-symmetric-key-cipher-operation)

Our development package (including runtime and development files) can be found `dist-6.6.17.tbz`. You may download and play with it before our lab officially starts. Updated `hellomod` codes is also provided `hellomod-6.6.17.tbz` for you.

The runtime contains a pre-built Linux kernel, a root filesystem, the modules required to build a module, and a script to boot the system with the QEMU emulator. To boot the sysetem, unpack the `dist` tarball and run the `qemu.sh` command.

You can try unpacking the root filesystem (`rootfs.cpio.bz2`) first to explore its contents. If needed, you can repack it after adding files. Additionally, check the `Makefile` inside `hellomod` to see how the built binaries are moved.

   :::warning
   You may need to set the cpio format to `newc` format. Also please ensure that you pack all the required files in the image.
   :::

You can develop the module on Apple chip macs but note that all the files must be cross-compiled to x86_64 architecture. We have created another docker-based runtime for you to build a cross-compilation environment for UNIX-based environment (Mac OS or WSL). You may download the files from [here (crossbuild.tbz)]. To run the runtime, please follow the steps below.

1. Unpack `crossbuild.tbz`, a `crossbuild` directory will be created with a build script and `Dockerfile`.

1. run `build.sh` in the `crossbuild` directory, a docker images called `chuang/build` will be created.

1. To compile your codes, ensure that you have the environment variables `UID` and `GID` setting to the user id and group id of the current user. Then, switch to your working directory and run the command:

   ```
   docker run -it --rm --user "$UID:$GID" -v "`pwd`:/build" -w /build -e PS1="buildenv:\w\$ " chuang/crossbuild /bin/bash --norc
   ```

    You can then cross-compile x86-64 binaries using the compiler `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc` to compile and generate binaries running on x86-64 platform.

   :::warning
   The cross-compilation command for building x86 modules on arm64 is `make ARCH=x86 CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-linux-gnu-`

:::info
Our course video `file+stdio` has introduced how `ioctl` works with a kernel module. This lab extends it by implementing more features in the kernel module.
