This lab aims to investigate possible race or reentrant errors from multithreaded programs. Please read the codes and solve the challenges available on the three challenge servers.

## Challenge #1

The challenge server #1 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 10931
```

Once you have connected to the challenge server, please dump the content of the `flag` file on the server.

We provide the source code of the challenge server for your reference [view].

## Challenge #2

The challenge server #2 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 10932
```

Once you have connected to the challenge server, please ask the challenge server to retrieve the secret from localhost:10000.

We provide the source code of the challenge server for your reference [view].

## Challenge  #3

The challenge server #3 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 10933
